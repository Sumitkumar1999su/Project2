Project2
For our first Github project, and btw its more complicated because we are collaborating, lets start slow and simple. 
Click on Code1.1_Uzman and thats what we can work on as 'main,' so like the finished thing. Like the front stage of a play
Please create your own Code1.1_YOURNAME and work on your code there. Write, execute, debug, chill. No judgement.
When you feel a section of your code is ready, just Whatsapp me and I'll add that part. Simple.
Ideally, GitHub offers forking and merging - integrated tools for this very thing. We'll skip that for next week.
If you have any questions, remember we are a team. Like....Avengers, but way less cool. Let's get frustrated about our bugs together.

Cheers, Uzman
